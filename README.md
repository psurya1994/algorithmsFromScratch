## Algorithms from scratch

These are the algorithms I implemented from scratch without using any codes are reference. I'm doing this to improve my theoretical understanding of concepts.

Here is a description of each of the notebooks:
- linear-regression.ipynb: implemented linear regression using grid and random searches
- linear-regression-gradient-descent.ipynb: implemented linear regression using gradient descent
- PCAFromScratch.ipynb: implemented PCA from scratch after reading 2.12 of the Deep Learning book.
