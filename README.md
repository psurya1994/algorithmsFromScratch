## Algorithms from scratch

These are the algorithms I implemented from scratch without using any codes are reference. I'm doing this to improve my theoretical understanding of concepts.

Here is a description of each of the notebooks:
- linear-regression.ipynb: implemented linear regression using grid and random searches
- linear-regression-gradient-descent.ipynb: implemented linear regression using gradient descent
- PCAFromScratch.ipynb: implemented PCA from scratch after reading 2.12 of the Deep Learning book.

Need to implement in future:
- Logistic regression
- Basic neural networks
- Convolutional neural networks
- Kmeans
- KNearestNeighbor
- Put all in the implementations in a library that I can use in future

As witnessed by the story of Ian Goodfellow, where he implemented GANs by applying game theory to ML (after a heated debate in a pub), being able to code from scratch is a very important skill to have. Something that I haven't done much of in the past. This repo is to turn that around.
