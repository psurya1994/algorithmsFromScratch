## Algorithms from scratch

These are the algorithms I implemented from scratch without using any codes are reference. I'm doing this to improve my theoretical understanding of concepts.

Here is a description of each of the notebooks:
- linear-regression.ipynb: implemented linear regression using grid and random searches
- linear-regression-gradient-descent.ipynb: implemented linear regression using gradient descent
- PCAFromScratch.ipynb: implemented PCA from scratch after reading 2.12 of the Deep Learning book.
- FindingUtilitiesInGridWorldUsingValueIteration.ipynb: this is a programming solution for one of the udacity assignments for the course ud600. It finds the utilities of each of the cells in a grid world. 
- ImplementingTD1Rule.ipynb: This notebook is an implementation of the TD(1) rule on a quiz question on the ud600 class.

Need to implement in future:
- Logistic regression
- Basic neural networks
- Convolutional neural networks
- Kmeans
- KNearestNeighbor
- Put all in the implementations in a library that I can use in future

As witnessed by the story of Ian Goodfellow, where he implemented GANs overnight after a heated debate in a pub (by applying game theory to ML), being able to code from scratch is a very important skill to have. It helps you implement and test any ideas you have quickly. Something that I haven't done much of in the past. This repo is to turn that around.
